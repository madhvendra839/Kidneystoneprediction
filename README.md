# Kidneystoneprediction
I participated in Kaggle's Playground Series competition on Binary Classification with a Kidney Stone Prediction Dataset, where I achieved a remarkable accuracy of nearly 90%. Out of 1200 participants, I secured an impressive rank of 101.

This competition provided me with an opportunity to showcase my expertise and skills in machine learning. I utilized my knowledge of data analysis, machine learning algorithms, and feature engineering to develop a model that accurately predicts the occurrence of kidney stones.

I am delighted to have achieved such outstanding results and feel proud of my hard work and dedication. This success is a testament to my ability to solve real-world problems using machine learning techniques.

Overall, the competition was a great learning experience, and I am grateful for the opportunity to participate. I look forward to future challenges and opportunities to improve my skills and expertise in the field of machine learning.
